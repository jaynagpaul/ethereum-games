## Ether Rockets
"Rockets are functionable and collectible digital assets that EtherRockets is centered on. You can obtain rockets in one of two ways - buying from the store or from other players on the marketplace. Rockets purchased on the store have a variable range of stats. For example, the starter rocket has a range of 16,000-18,000 for its "top speed" stat and is only discover-able after you purchase the rocket. This results in over 100,000 unique combinations of rockets for each type."

CryptoPets are digital critters that are one-of-a-kind and one hundred percent owned by you; they cannot be replicated, taken away, or destroyed. Will feature an interactive ecosystem of mini games and districts for our pets to feed, breed, and compete."

## Ether Craft
"A decentralized RPG running on the Ethereum Blockchain. Features trading, crafting, and dungeon crawling on the blockchain."

## Etherization
"Etherization is a civilization like game on Ethereum blockchain, written in Solidity, due to gas limits per block split in 3 contracts. Players add or withdraw ether to their treasury; by playing well they can increase it and make profit. It is possible to increase treasury by capturing other players' cities or by developing their own cities and taking a cut in other players' actions through production buildings. Before making the next move, players have to wait a fixed period of time, currently set to 6 hours (18 seconds on test private-net).
There are 3 units types and 5 building types."

## The Pyramid Game
"Spend some Ether to buy a block.
Blocks at the bottom layer are 0.005 ETH. Blocks at each next layer are worth twice as much as the layer below.
When someone places a block on top of yours, you'll get half their bet. So, when two blocks have been placed on top of yours, you've doubled your money!"

## Cryptopunks
"What you see above are the 10,000 unique "CryptoPunks" in a map-like interface. No two are exactly alike, and each one of them can be officially owned by a single person on the Ethereum blockchain. Originally, they could be claimed for free by anybody with an Ethereum wallet, but all 10,000 were quickly claimed. Now they must be purchased from someone on the Ethereum marketplace contract. Via this market you can buy, bid on, and offer punks for sale."

## Etheremon
"Etheremon is a decentralized application built on the Ethereum network. It simulates a world of ether monsters (etheremon) where you can capture, trade and evolve etheremon to defeat others."

## Ethergarden
"Ethergarden is the first virtual garden on the Ethereum blockchain. Plant a tree, make it grow and be the tallest! In Ethergarden everybody can plant his tree (with a specific name and url) and water it to make it grow taller or cut other trees to make them shrink, by paying in ETH.
